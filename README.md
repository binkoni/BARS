 Beer Auto Recognition System for mobile




## 1. What is BARS?

<b>Beer Auto Recognition System(BARS)</b> is a mobile application that will help you search beers that you've never seen before.

Every Beer has it's distinct label that differentiates it from others. If you see a beer that you've never seen before or not familiar, take a photo of it's label with your phone camera and upload it at BARS application.
When the photo is uploaded, BARS program will operate through Image-Classification-Model based on deep-learning and find a match with the product on our database. 
When it is matched, information about beer comes up at the screen including the name, manufacturer, ABV(alcohol), type, avg.price, style, ratings.


To make the features more reliable, we will refer to the data on worldwide famous beer information websites such as ‘www.ratebeer.com’ or ‘www.beeradvocate.com’.
For maintenance, continuous interest to new beer products is required.

Just then, you notice that there are lots of imported beers that you’ve never drank before. There are too many choices and it’s even hard to read the label because it’s written in foreign language.

##### case 2)

Take photos of two beers. upload it on the BARS app. You notice that the rating of those two beers are pretty low. You put those beers back on the shell and take some more photos of Korean beer. After a while, you find a beer with rather high rating. Grab it and enjoy it.
